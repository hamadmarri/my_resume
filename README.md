    This is an obfuscated C source code that prints my resume.
    
    To see my resume you need to run this code
    
    To compile and run (in linux): gcc myresume.c && ./a.out | less
    
    If you are a windows user who hires developers (please don't hire me).
    
    If you are an HR who doesn't know what this is, consult 
    your programmers (they are much more useful than you).
